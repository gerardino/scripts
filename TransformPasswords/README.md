# Transform Passwords

A very simple script to convert the CSV from Firefox Lockwise to 1Password format. This changes:

* Outputs only the four required columns (https://support.1password.com/import-mac/)
* Creates a name/title column based on the domain name, which it tries to clean a little bit by removing "alias" subdomains.


## Requirements

  * Node 14 (it's probably compatible with 12+)

## How to run

Invoke with node and give it the CSV generated by Firefox Lockwise, default output is `output.csv`.

```sh
  node index.js input_file.csv [output_file.csv]
```

More options to run coming soon!
